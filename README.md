**- This plugin is still in development -**

A SignalK plugin that logs sailing passages and uploads them to **Boatly**.

**Boatly** is a free web application that enables you to upload and share your sailing passages:

Recording automatically starts when the vessel moves a defined number of meters from the vessel's initial position.   Recording stops, and the end of the passage is determined, when the vessel has been stationary for a defined number of minutes.

The following data is logged:
- Position (lat & lon)
- Course over ground (COG)
- Speed over ground (SOG)
- True wind speed
- True wind angle
- True wind direction
